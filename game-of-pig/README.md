##Game Rules:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- Each turn, player rolls the dice as many times as he wants. Each roll gets added to the ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all that ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that the ROUND score gets added to the GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
